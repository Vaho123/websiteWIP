<strong>Act 1</strong>
<p>"<mark>The mystery of the blue train.</mark>" said De’Ath reading the caption on the back of the photo he was looking at, depicting a blue train seemingly floating in mid-air, in the background.</p>
<p>"Where was that?" I asked.  After a second or two, he answered, </p>
<p>"Unknown."  </p>
<p>	The photo in front of me was one of De’Ath on a merry-go-round, prompting me to quip, "I looked, and there before me was a <mark>pale horse</mark>!  Its rider was named De’Ath."  He didn’t laugh.  I thumbed through the other photos in my hands, reading the respective captions as I went – <mark>De’Ath on the Nile; De’Ath at Bertram’s Hotel.</mark>took this picture, what was your <mark>destination</mark>?"</p>
<p>	"<mark>Unknown</mark>"came De’Ath’s stock reply.</p>
<p>	For too long, De’Ath had been trying to decide whether the photo he’d entered into a travel photograph competition some time ago, had been the best one.  I was getting a little tired of De’Ath and all his adventures, so when a knock came at the door, I was grateful for the interruption.  </p>
<p>Picking up the <mark>mousetrap </mark> in the hallway, to prevent damage to the puppies’ paws, I opened the door to a small, well-dressed man, slightly portly, with a distinctive moustache.  Quite odd, this man, I thought.  The moment there was a crack through which to speak, he announced, unbidden,</p>
<p> "I have an <mark>appointment with De’Ath.	</mark>"</p>
<p>"Really?  I don’t think he’s expecting you.  You are?"</p>
<p>	"Mr. Quin."</p>
<p>	Carefully negotiating Hercules, De’Ath’s dog, I led <mark>the unexpected guest</mark> through to the small, cluttered, lounge.</p>
<p>	"Good to see you, sir." said De’Ath holding out his hand to shake.  "How can I help?"</p>
<p>	Observing none of the traditional greeting customs, Quin said,</p>
<p>	"I don’t believe in dilly-dallying about, so I’ll come straight to the point."</p>
<p>	"Absolutely." agreed De’Ath, putting down his unshaken hand.</p>
<p>	"There’s been a<mark> murder in the mews</mark>, and … er … my sister’s gone missing."</p>
<p>	"And you think the two are connected?"</p>
<p>	"No, no.  They’re totally unrelated, I’m sure.  That is…  I’m not absolutely sure.  Not entirely, one hundred percent sure."  He paused a while before continuing, "In fact, I’m not at all sure.  But if she is involved...  I’m sure… I know… I think she’s innocent of murder.  Either way, I would like you to investigate – both the murder and my sister’s disappearance.  One thing I do know is, my sister took the train to Frankfurt, but never arrived.  She’s been missing ever since."</p>
<p>	Unsettling, I thought.</p>
<p>	"From the beginning." said De’Ath, </p>
<p>	"It’s a bit of a long story."</p>
<p>	"I’ve plenty of time." said De’Ath, sitting down and settling in for the long haul. </p>
<p>	"Well.  It all started <mark>after the funeral</mark> in …er … where was it…?"</p>
