<p>"Empty your pockets." she demanded.  Money, keys, shopping lists, old receipts spilled on to the counter. "Jewellery?" she asked, scrutinising my neck and ears.  I pointed to my watch and raised my eyebrows.  She nodded, as I placed my watch alongside my other belongings.  She pointed to the white bathroom scales just to my left.  Feeling unstable, due to an acute attack of nerves, I stepped onto them with care.  She recorded my weight on the ticket she gave me, before directing me to a door diagonally opposite the one through which I had entered the small shed like cabin.  Framed in the doorway, I stood, holding on to both sides for support, ticket in hand, looking at what was to come.</p>
<p>	My mouth was dry.  My heart screamed to escape.  Part of me wanted to run away, leave immediately.  Part of me feared what was to come.  Part of me was excited by the prospect.  I stepped through the door to the other side, onto a landing,   above an area of grass cordoned off by temporary fencing.  Self conscious, I looked at the crowds around the perimeter, relaxing a little when I realised they weren’t watching me.  All eyes were focussed on the next incumbent of the position I would soon be taking up myself.  Holding onto the rail, I walked down the steps slowly and with care.</p>
<p>	There were four hard, plastic seats within the cordon, three close together, side by side.  The other was on the same latitude but a little distance away.  A fifth seat, the hot seat, a wooden kitchen chair, was placed almost centrally within the arena.  An arena surrounded by crowds of onlookers, three or four people deep, all eager for spectacle.  I imagined it to be similar to what a public hanging would have been like, back in the 17 and 18 hundreds.  A crowd baying for blood.  Hoping for, cheering for the worst to happen, to someone else, not them.  Inwardly I smirked at the idea that what was about to happen, was not far off that hanging scenario, and it was going to happen, to me.</p>
<p>I looked at the occupants of the three chairs close to me.  Were those smiles on their faces, or grimaces?  Were their nerves as ragged as mine?  Did they feel the same mixture of fear and excited anticipation as I did?  Had they been able to eat any breakfast that morning?  I hadn’t.</p>
<p>I made my way to the desk just to my right.  Again, I stepped onto a set of bathroom scales, as requested.  This weight almost matching that written on my ticket, I was given a sickly green tabard to wear – as if I didn’t feel ill enough.  I was led to the first, now vacant chair, where I sat, grateful for the support, as my nerves bounced around, like a ball in a pinball machine.  My eyes flitted around the arena.  At the crowds.  At what was to come.  My friends.  Where were my friends?  I couldn’t see them in the crowd.  But I knew they must be there, somewhere.  But right now I had more important things to focus on.  An attendant knelt down in front of me before binding my ankles together.  He told me to put my feet closer together, so he could bind them tighter.  He bound them so tightly, there was no give at all.  It was impossible to separate one foot from the other.  Impossible even to fit a finger between them.  I felt totally immobilised.  And to think I’d volunteered for this.  Paid even.</p>
<p>The only way to travel when trussed up like a chicken, is to bunny hop, thus I travelled to the next seat, which had just become vacant, as each of the other chickens had moved along one.  Another would-be chicken joined us, to my right.  Was that a smile, or a grimace she was giving me?  What did she make of the smile/grimace I returned?</p>
<p>As I sat, my mind whirling with excitement, adrenalin and not a little anxiety, a stranger stooped before me, checking my bonds. He pulled on them hard, ensuring they were secure.  Ensuring there was no chance of escape.  No chance of backing out.  Appearing satisfied, he looked up, smiling his evident knowledge of what in store for me, as I hopped to the next seat along.  Another chicken joined us, to our right.</p>
<p>Eventually, I made it to the fourth seat, the one on the same line, but set apart from the others.  A different stranger looked at my ticket, checked the colour of the tabard I was wearing and, like the previous strangers, checked the security of my ankle bonds.  As satisfied as the previous strangers had been, he indicated for me to go and sit in the vacant chair in the middle of the arena.  The hot seat.  </p>
